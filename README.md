Welcome to the GitHub repository of WrenGuard, a project dedicated to the conservation of endangered grasswrens in Australia. Our platform leverages technology to aid in the protection and study of these vital species, particularly focusing on the critically endangered Mukarrthippi Grasswren.

## About WrenGuard

WrenGuard is a collaborative initiative aimed at combating the critical decline of grasswren populations due to habitat degradation and other environmental threats. Our project is part of the broader "Life on Land" initiative and works closely with local rangers, residents, and regional conservation groups.

## Problem Statement

Australia's vibrant grasswren populations are facing critical decline. Species like the Mukarrthippi Grasswren are on the brink of extinction, with less than 20 individuals remaining as of 2023. The Grey Grasswren population also faces significant threat, with numbers dropping below 200 posing a serious threat to both biodiversity and cultural heritage on life on land. Grasswrens play a crucial role in the ecosystem, and their disappearance would create a significant void.  Habitat degradation is the primary culprit behind the population decline.  Overgrazing by livestock and feral animals, coupled with increased wildfire frequency and intensity, destroys critical nesting grounds and exposes these flight-limited birds to greater danger. How might fostering collaboration between local volunteers and regional conservation groups will create a stronger network to combat habitat loss and protect these iconic birds?

## Our Solution

WrenGuard features a predictive model for wildfires, providing local stakeholders with critical information to mitigate risks and plan conservation efforts effectively.
